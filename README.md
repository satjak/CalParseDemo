iCalendar Cleanup Parse Demo

Using apple calendar, you can export an acrchive of a calender.
This will parse the calendar.ics and result in a cleaned up calendar.ics
Lots of meta data will be removed in the process.

This is a demo, no promises have been made.

I used the icalendar parsing tool located here
